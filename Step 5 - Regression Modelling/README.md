# Regression Modelling

Finally, the processed time series are then added as input to our regression models for food insecurity in the iPython notebook: "3. Fig3_regression.ipynb". This notebook generates the data that is plotted in Fig 3. Please download the processed time series dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OtNqeDjTW7IVlnfgYiMyrIbvAyx4q_27?usp=sharing and change the filepath in the notebook to a relevant path in your directory.
