# Causal Feature Extraction

For the identification of causal features, we utilized the methodology presented by [Swayamdipta et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09528) in their project [Open-SESAME](https://github.com/swabhs/open-sesame). They develop a frame-semantic parser to automatically detect FrameNet frames and frame-elements from sentences. In our context, these soft-max margin segmental recurrent neural nets help us identify important features in food insecurity prediction. An example of the frame-semantic parse is shown below:

You can follow their instructions [here](https://github.com/swabhs/open-sesame) to replicate the causal feature extraction for your own project.

Follow the rest of our project's methodology with the [Granger Test for Time Series](https://github.com/philippzi98/food_insecurity_predictions_nlp/tree/main/Feature%202:%20Time%20Series%20Granger%20Test).
